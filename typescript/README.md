### FP vs OOP


|                        Feature | Object Oriented Programming | Functional Programming |
| -----------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :--------------------: |
|            First Class Citizen |           Classes           |       Functions        |
|                   Polymorphism |  Interfaces / Inheritance   |  Function parameters   |
|                       Behavior |          Inherited          |        Composed        |
| Data and Function Relationship |            Bound            |        Separate        |
|         Relationship to Change |          Mutations          |         Purity         |
|              Higher Level View |         Simulation          |     Transformation     |

Perhaps oddly, languages have taken to supporting both as they each have powerful attributes.

### So... Why Typescript?

1. Static analysis is a fast sanity check. It catches stupid errors like forgetting to unwrap optionals, misspellings, and so on.
2. It serves as documentation
3. It helps with autocomplete
